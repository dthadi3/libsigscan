TODO:
* make sure scan buffer is sufficient large for bounded scan
* make sure to handle offsets from end of file
  - need scan buffer to look for both
* state add relative_from_start, relative_from_end and unbound scan trees and active nodes

* is there a pratical need to support signature with patterns that contain pattern gaps?
* unbounded scan
  - determine optimal buffer size
  - buffer size vs scan block size?
  - handle boundary matches
  - add range to determine size of scan buffer?
* signature table
  - add support for unbounded signatures (LIBSIGSCAN_PATTERN_OFFSET_UNBOUND)
* scanner
  - add support for unbounded signatures
* add memory aligned reads?

Tools:
* sigscan/scan_handle
  - read signatures
  - print result offset

Tests:
* sigscan_test_scanner
  - add scan result (signature) identifier check
  - offsets relative from end
  - scan file and file IO handle
  - build scan tree with no signatures, single signature, multiple signatures
  - different buffer sizes
* pysigscan_test_scanner
  - fix TODOs
  - offsets relative from end
  - scan file and file object
  - build scan tree with no signatures, single signature, multiple signatures
* sigscan
  - add test

TODO:
* complete initial version of library
* complete initial version Python bindings
* is there a pratical need to support signature with patterns that contain pattern gaps?
* unbounded scan
  - determine optimal buffer size
  - buffer size vs scan block size?
* signature table
  - add support for unbounded signatures (LIBSIGSCAN_PATTERN_OFFSET_UNBOUND)
* scanner
  - add support for "negative offsets" (relative from end)
  - add support for unbounded signatures
* add memory aligned reads?
